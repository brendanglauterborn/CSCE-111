<p> Hello, my name is <u>Brendan Lauterborn.</u> I am from the Waldorf, Maryland. This is about 30 minutes outside of DC. I spent a lot of time in the city as a kid. I grew up listening to a lot of old school Hip-hop. This includes artists such as Nas, Too $hort, Scarface, Compton's Most Wanted, and more. I also listen to a lot of new school rappers such as Joey Bada$$, Young Thug, Capital STEEZ, A$AP Rocky, ScHoolboy Q, Mick Jenkins, and more. Just recently, I have started to make my own music. One day I hope to turn this passion into something big. I am also studying Applied Mathematics here at Texas A&M University.</p>
